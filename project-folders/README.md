# Blockchain-Based Product Authentication System 🔐

This project is a blockchain-powered product authentication and verification system. It helps prevent counterfeiting by allowing users to scan dynamic QR codes and validate product authenticity in real-time.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Blockchain-backed product verification (Ethereum/Ganache)
- ✅ QR code generation and scanning
- ✅ Secure and tamper-proof authentication
- ✅ Simple frontend (React) with backend (Flask)
- ✅ MetaMask wallet integration

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Blockchain**: Ethereum, Solidity, Ganache, MetaMask  
- **Backend**: Python, Flask  
- **Frontend**: React.js  
- **Database**: JSON/IPFS (or similar local structure)  
- **QR Codes**: Python QR Libraries

## 🔗 How It Works

1. Product details are stored securely on the blockchain.
2. A QR code is generated and printed on the product.
3. The consumer scans the code to verify its authenticity.
4. The system checks the blockchain and displays verification.
